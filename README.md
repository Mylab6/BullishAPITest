#Bullish API Test 

Based off the official skeleton provided by the Cucumber organization 

https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-java-skeleton

TestAPI has 7 tests , one of which fails intentionally as the Swagger documentation is wrong. Queries for students that don't exist will always return a 200 OK status code, rather than a 404 Not Found status code.
TestWebPage has 5 tests, all of which pass.
